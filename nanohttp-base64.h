 *
 * Base encoding of data is used in many situations to store or
 * transfer data in environments that, perhaps for legacy reasons,
 * are restricted to US-ASCII data. Base64 encoding can also be used
 * in new applications that do not have legacy restrictions, simply
 * because it makes it possible to manipulate objects with text
 * editors.
 *
 * In the past, different applications have had different requirements
 * and thus sometimes implemented base encodings in slightly different
 * ways. Today, protocol specifications sometimes use base encodings
 * in general, and "base64" in particular, without a precise
 * description or reference.  Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions
 * (MIME) is often used as a reference for base64 without considering
 * the consequences for line-wrapping or non-alphabet characters.
