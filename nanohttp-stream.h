 * nanoHTTP supports 2 different streams:
 * -# http_input_stream_t
 * -# http_output_stream_t
 *
 * These are not regular streams. They will care about transfer styles while
 * sending/receiving data.
 *
 * Supported transfer styles are
 *
 * - Content-length
 * - Chunked encoding
 * - Connection: "close"
 *
 * A stream will set its transfer style from the header information, which must
 * be given while creating a stream.
 *
 * A stream will start sending/receiving data "after" sending/receiving header
 * information (After CR LF CR LF)."
