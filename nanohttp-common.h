/** @defgroup HTTP_STATUS_CODES HTTP status-codes
 * @ingroup NANOHTTP
 *
 * The Status-Code element is a 3-digit integer result code of the attempt to
 * understand and satisfy the request. These codes are fully defined in section
 * 10. The Reason-Phrase is intended to give a short textual description of the
 * Status-Code. The Status-Code is intended for use by automata and the
 * Reason-Phrase is intended for the human user. The client is not required to
 * examine or display the Reason- Phrase. The first digit of the Status-Code
 * defines the class of response. The last two digits do not have any
 * categorization role. There are 5 values for the first digit: 
 *
 * - @ref status_informational_sec - Request received, continuing process
 * - @ref status_successful_sec - The action was successfully received,
 *        understood, and accepted 
 * - @ref status_redirection_sec - Further action must be taken in order to
 *        complete the request
 * - @ref status_client_error_sec - The request contains bad syntax or cannot be
 *        fulfilled
 * - @ref status_server_error_sec - The server failed to fulfill an apparently
 *        valid request
 *
 * The individual values of the numeric status codes defined for HTTP/1.1, and an
 * example set of corresponding Reason-Phrase's, are presented below. The reason
 * phrases listed here are only recommendations -- they MAY be replaced by local
 * equivalents without affecting the protocol.
 *
 * HTTP status codes are extensible. HTTP applications are not required to
 * understand the meaning of all registered status codes, though such
 * understanding is obviously desirable. However, applications MUST understand
 * the class of any status code, as indicated by the first digit, and treat any
 * unrecognized response as being equivalent to the x00 status code of that class,
 * with the exception that an unrecognized response MUST NOT be cached. For
 * example, if an unrecognized status code of 431 is received by the client, it
 * can safely assume that there was something wrong with its request and treat
 * the response as if it had received a 400 status code. In such cases, user
 * agents SHOULD present to the user the entity returned with the response,
 * since that entity is likely to include human-readable information which will
 * explain the unusual status.
 *
 * @section status_informational_sec 1xx Informational
 *
 * This class of status code indicates a provisional response, consisting only
 * of the Status-Line and optional headers, and is terminated by an empty line.
 * There are no required headers for this class of status code. Since HTTP/1.0
 * did not define any 1xx status codes, servers MUST NOT send a 1xx response to
 * an HTTP/1.0 client except under experimental conditions.
 *
 * A client MUST be prepared to accept one or more 1xx status responses prior to
 * a regular response, even if the client does not expect a 100 (Continue)
 * status message. Unexpected 1xx status responses MAY be ignored by a user
 * agent.
 *
 * Proxies MUST forward 1xx responses, unless the connection between the proxy
 * and its client has been closed, or unless the proxy itself requested the
 * generation of the 1xx response. (For example, if a proxy adds a
 * "Expect: 100-continue" field when it forwards a request, then it need not
 * forward the corresponding 100 (Continue) response(s).)
 *
 * @section status_successful_sec 2xx Successful
 *
 * This class of status code indicates that the client's request was
 * successfully received, understood, and accepted.
 *
 * @section status_redirection_sec 3xx Redirection
 *
 * This class of status code indicates that further action needs to be taken by
 * the user agent in order to fulfill the request.  The action required MAY be
 * carried out by the user agent without interaction with the user if and only
 * if the method used in the second request is GET or HEAD. A client SHOULD
 * detect infinite redirection loops, since such loops generate network traffic
 * for each redirection.
 *
 * @section status_client_error_sec 4xx Client Error
 *
 * The 4xx class of status code is intended for cases in which the client seems
 * to have erred. Except when responding to a HEAD request, the server SHOULD
 * include an entity containing an explanation of the error situation, and
 * whether it is a temporary or permanent condition. These status codes are
 * applicable to any request method. User agents SHOULD display any included
 * entity to the user.
 *
 * If the client is sending data, a server implementation using TCP SHOULD be
 * careful to ensure that the client acknowledges receipt of the packet(s)
 * containing the response, before the server closes the input connection. If
 * the client continues sending data to the server after the close, the server's
 * TCP stack will send a reset packet to the client, which may erase the client's
 * unacknowledged input buffers before they can be read and interpreted by the
 * HTTP application.
 *
 * @section status_server_error_sec 5xx Server Error
 *
 * Response status codes beginning with the digit "5" indicate cases in which
 * the server is aware that it has erred or is incapable of performing the
 * request. Except when responding to a HEAD request, the server SHOULD include
 * an entity containing an explanation of the error situation, and whether it is
 * a temporary or permanent condition. User agents SHOULD display any included
 * entity to the user. These response codes are applicable to any request method.
 *
 * Each Status-Code is described below, including a description of which
 * method(s) it can follow and any metainformation required in the response.
